# RSClone - MonkeyType

## Project description

Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. It features many test modes, an account system to save your 
typing speed history, and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds and more. 
Monkeytype attempts to emulate the experience of natural keyboard typing during a typing test, by 
unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in-place, providing straightforward, 
real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.
